                        Simply put, we can say that the QR code is the natural evolution of the barcode. Its name derives from "Quick Response Code", due to the speed at which they can be scanned. This code allows for easy access to different information through a mobile device.

                        They are as useful as all the different types of content they can offer. In fact, in recent years, this type of code is becoming more widely accepted among all kinds of people. It's logical, since with just one scan you can access a great deal of varied information and even facilitate certain tasks such as connecting to a Wi-Fi network. A QR code can help you improve the service or product you offer, interact with your customers and promote your business, among other things.

                    How do you read a QR?

                        There are several factors that influence whether a person or potential customer can read a QR code, but without a doubt the most important factor is that the individual who wants to scan the code needs to have a mobile phone. Nowadays, there are many mobile devices that can read QR codes with the camera itself, by simply pointing the camera at the code to scan it. If this doesn't work, you may need to download an application designed to read QR codes. But don't worry! There are several apps that do just this.                    </p>
